# RecursionError in Factorial Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions: forgetting to handle the base case properly.  The `factorial` function, without proper handling of negative input, leads to infinite recursion and a `RecursionError`. The solution includes adding a check for negative inputs and handling this scenario appropriately.
